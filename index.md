## About me
An iterant biologist and science communicator (mostly for school aged students). I am aspiring to do things that help improve lives through real science and hopefully some data analysis.

## [CpG frequencies](CpG-in-covid)
This is a simple project for learning how to do some bioinformatics, use git and github better and get a better understanding of biopython and the practicality of doing something like this in python.

## [todo list parsing](todo-parsing)
When I worked as a research assistant I was asked to keep a todo list to record what I planned to do and what I managed to get done. I managed to hold onto these and have collated them together. I present some data from them here.

## [expected value demonstration using ipython and ipywidgets](coin-flip-EV-demonstration)
Simple implementation of coin flip expected value simulation using ipython and ipywidgets in jupyter.
