For fun and profit.

This page uses essentially straight HTML + css. And was used as a way to learn flexbox HTMl and css styling.

It still relies on Jekyll when on github's servers. Indeed, to get a reproducible local build I have setup a `docker_compose.yml` which can run this for local checks.

I also have a pixi install to try and handle the python(?!) and `act` (local gh actions) dependencies.
